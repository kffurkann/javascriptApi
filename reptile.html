                <p>Reptilia; It is called the class of quadrupedal vertebrates with variable body temperature amnion.
                    Reptiles form an evolutionary step between amphibians, birds and mammals. Available evidence shows
                    that birds and mammals arose from reptilian ancestors.
                Thanks to their flying abilities, birds are distributed all over the world. The number of bird
                    species anywhere on earth generally depends on the variety of suitable habitats and the size of the
                    area.</p>

                <p>Reptiles have a well-keratinized skin, covered with exoderm-derived scales, and have almost no glands
                    inside; The corium is even ossified in some cases. (tortoise of turtles) The skull is attached to
                    the spine with a single occipital bite. Two aortic arches emerge from the heart, which consists of 2
                    atria and a ventricle partially divided into two cavities (separate in crocodiles). The lung has a
                    complex structure, but there are uncombed sections (air sacs) at the back. The main features of the
                    digestive tract are: a usually thick tongue, teeth adapted to the feeding regime (only crocodiles
                    have tooth sockets, and the mouth of turtles is shaped like a horny beak), and a posterior fecal
                    chamber, through which the urinary and reproductive tracts open.</p>

                <p>Sensory organs show some characteristics in reptiles; For example, the Jacobsob organ (or additional
                    olfactory organ) allows snakes to immediately probe their immediate surroundings with their forked
                    tongues. There are many cone-shaped cells in the retina of diurnal reptiles (colour vision). All
                    reptiles except snakes have a middle ear with a single ossicle and a columella, and the inner ear
                    extends in the direction of the abdomen and tail as a cochlea.</p>
                <p>Males of all reptiles have copulatory organs, except for the species called Tuatara. While most
                    species reproduce by laying eggs, in some the eggs hatch inside the female and live offspring are
                    born. In a few species, the young inside the female are fed through an organ similar to the ethene
                    of mammals.
                </p>
                <p>Today's reptiles, with a total number of species of around 6 thousand, have a wide geographical
                    distribution in warm and temperate regions, but are mostly found in the tropics. The northward range
                    of a lizard species and the common viper is also the extreme point that all reptiles can reach in
                    the north. The geographical distribution of these 2 species extends to the Arctic Region in Eurasia.
