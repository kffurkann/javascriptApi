                <p>Birds is the common name for the warm-blooded vertebrates that make up the Aves class. Their most
                    distinctive feature is the feathers that cover their bodies and are unique in any other animal
                    group. Its front legs were adapted to flight, and its upper and lower jaws, which were covered with
                    feathers and toothless, lengthened to take the form of a beak. A calcareous shell covers its eggs.
                    Their eyes are the most developed sensory organs used to perceive the environment.</p>
                <p>Thanks to their flying abilities, birds are distributed all over the world. The number of bird
                    species anywhere on earth generally depends on the variety of suitable habitats and the size of the
                    area.</p>
                <p>There are nearly 8000 species of birds in the world today. The diet of birds is as diverse as their
                    species. If we categorize the birds into main groups in terms of nutrition: Those that feed on
                    insects, such as beluga swallows, swallows and shepherds; carnivores such as vulture, heron,
                    kingfisher and tern, and those that feed on plant substances with high nutritional value such as
                    seeds, fruits and nectar. A few species eat leaves and buds.</p>

                <p>If they are classified by looking at the external structure of their legs and beaks, we get more
                    diversity such as running birds, web-footed, stilt-like, chicken-like, pigeon-like, birds of prey,
                    climbing birds and songbirds. For a long time, scientists classified birds like this. Today's
                    scientists divide birds into more numerous but more meaningful sections, taking into account both
                    their internal anatomy and external characteristics.</p>
                <p>Birds have a heart with 4 chambers (2 atria and 2 ventricles) in their circulatory system, which is
                    similar to that of mammals. However, the adult has a right large aortic arch. (In mammals, however,
                    this arch is on the left.) The central nervous system is complex; the brain is larger than that of
                    reptiles; The cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum are very developed; The center of the striated
                    body in the brain hemispheres is very complex.</p>
                <p>The olfactory organ is thought to play a minor role in birds. Although the sense of hearing is well
                    developed, the sounds perceived are fewer than those of mammals. But their voices are very
                    developed; Each species has a variety of sounds and often a specific song. Unlike mammals, the vocal
                    organ is not the larynx, but the larynx, located where the trachea divides into the bronchi, or
                    sometimes in the trachea.</p>

                <p>If we examine birds in terms of reproduction, they reproduce with eggs. Generally, the number of eggs
                    laid in a nest varies from species to species. (Between 1-20 or even more) For the normal
                    development of the embryo, the egg must be at a certain temperature. With some rare exceptions
                    (hyriapods), this temperature is achieved by incubation. Most of the time, the female incubates,
                    sometimes both the male, the female and the male, and sometimes only the target bird. Brood plates
                    usually develop on the abdomen of the incubating bird, and the temperature of these plates is higher
                    than the rest of the skin. The incubation period varies depending on the size of the egg, from 12
                    days (some songbirds and woodpeckers) to 80 days (kiwi).</p>
                <p>Group living habits vary greatly from species to species. Some always live together and nest in
                    colonies; some are separated from each other during the breeding season; Some, who normally live
                    alone, come together to establish a home. Although their main activities are based on solid
                    instincts, birds have abilities such as recognition, selection, adaptation and a very strong memory.
                </p>
                <p>As a settlement, birds live in all parts of the world, up to the poles and the permanent snow limit
                    in the mountains. Although seabirds are found in all oceans, none of them leave land when breeding.
                    The places where birds are most abundant, both in terms of species and number, are rainy tropical
                    countries. Most birds in cold and temperate regions cannot spend the winter there and therefore make
                    more or less regular migrations.</p>
