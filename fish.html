                <p>Fish is the general name of cold-blooded vertebrates with different evolutionary lines that live in
                    fresh and salt water. This term describes a way of life rather than a classification. Fish living
                    today are generally grouped under 5 classes. These classes are as different from each other as the 4
                    classes of air-breathing animals: amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.</p>
                <p>Fish, which have a history of approximately 450 million years, have evolved to adapt to almost all
                    types of aquatic environments during this time. Since they underwent a great change during the
                    transition to the land environment and turned into 4-legged land vertebrates, these aquatic
                    creatures are actually the first ancestors of land vertebrates.</p>
                <p>When we say fish, we usually think of an aquatic animal that has fins, gills, a respiring body, and a
                    slippery body suitable for moving in water. However, the number of fish that do not fit this
                    description is much higher than those that do. The bodies of some of them are expanded
                    longitudinally, some of them are short, flattened especially in those living at the bottom, and in
                    many of them they are pressed from the sides. The position of their mouths, eyes, nostrils and gills
                    also varies greatly from species to species.</p>

                <p>The basic structure and function of the fish body is similar to that of all other vertebrates. The
                    four basic tissues that make up the body of land vertebrates are also present in fish: epithelial
                    tissue covering the outer surfaces, connective and support tissue (bone, cartilage and fibrous
                    tissues and their derivatives), nervous tissue and muscle tissue. The typical fish body is
                    spindle-shaped with a streamlined profile adapted for swimming: it consists of a head, body and
                    tail.</p>
                <p>The trunk cavity, which contains vital organs, is usually on the lower front side of the body. At the
                    posterior end of this cavity, just in front of the base of the anal fin, is the anal hole through
                    which feces are discharged. The spinal cord and vertebrae start from the posterior part of the skull
                    skeleton, pass through the dorsal body cavity and tail area, and end at the base of the caudal fin.
                </p>
                <p>Although there are many different types of reproduction in fish, the most common is based on the
                    fertilization of countless small eggs laid by the female in the water outside the body. The eggs of
                    surface fish in the open sea are generally clear as if suspended in water; Coastal and freshwater
                    fish lay their eggs on the seabed or among plants; Some species even stick their eggs to rocks or
                    plants with a secretion. The sperm that will fertilize the eggs are produced in the 2 (sometimes 1)
                    testes in the trunk cavity of the male and are discharged into the water with a liquid of milky
                    consistency and color. In bony fish, a sperm duct originating from each of the testicles opens into
                    the urogenital hole behind the anus, and in sharks and rays, it opens into the feces. Some fish also
                    have a type of mating organ that allows the male to ejaculate his sperm into the female's oviduct
                    (internal fertilization).</p>

                <p>If we look at fish in terms of sensory organs; Their sense of smell is of great importance to almost
                    all fish. Some eels with very small eyes rely on their sense of smell rather than sight to locate
                    their food.</p>
                <p>The sense of taste is also very developed in most fish; There are taste organs not only in the oral
                    cavity but also in some parts of the head and body. Perhaps the most important organ in terms of
                    nutrition, avoiding dangers, and reproduction and survival is the eye. Although the eyes of fish are
                    similar to those of all other vertebrates in terms of their basic structure and function, they show
                    different characteristics because they are adapted to very different living conditions. Fish that
                    live in dark and dim environments generally have large eyes. However, if another sense develops
                    excessively and becomes dominant, the function of the eyes decreases. For them, sound perception and
                    balance are two senses that are closely related to each other. Sound waves, especially low-frequency
                    waves, that spread easily in the water, hit the head and body fluids and bones of the fish and are
                    transmitted to the hearing organs. The range of sound frequencies detectable by fish is very
                    different from that of humans; This comes from the speed of sound propagation in water. It is
                    thought that many fish communicate with each other by grinding their teeth against each other or
                    making sounds in other ways.</p>
